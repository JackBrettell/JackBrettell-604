  weaponDescription: "The assault rifle\u2014the perfect solution when a pistol just
    isn\u2019t loud or excessive enough. Why settle for a few measly shots when you
    can spray an entire room with bullets and still somehow miss half your targets?
    Ideal for those who enjoy relentless recoil, constant ammo refills, and the illusion
    of tactical superiority."
