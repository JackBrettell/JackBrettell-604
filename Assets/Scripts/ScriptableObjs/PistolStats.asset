  weaponDescription: "The pistol\u2014what an absolute marvel of firepower. Who needs
    a high-capacity rifle when you can have this tiny, underpowered, last-resort
    weapon that barely holds a handful of rounds? Perfect for when you want to make
    your enemy mildly annoyed before they take you out with something actually effective."
